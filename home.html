            <p class="placeholder-text">My name is Ethan Himes. I'm an Emerging Technology in Business and Design student at Miami University. Throughout my life, I've always had a passion for making things. Anything and everything. I have a history of learning a variety of skills to achieve my goal. This background includes but not limited to coding, 3D printing, and sewing. Most of my inspiration comes from works of fiction, most notably Sci-fi like Cyberpunk.
