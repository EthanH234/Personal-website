            <h2>About me</h2>
            <p class="placeholder-text">My name is Ethan Himes. I'm an Emerging Technology in Business and Design student at Miami University. Throughout my life, I've always had a passion for making things. Anything and everything. I have a history of learning a variety of skills to achieve my goal. This background includes but not limited to coding, 3D printing, and sewing. Most of my inspiration comes from works of fiction, most notably Sci-fi like Cyberpunk</p>


            <h2>Skills learned from ETBD</h2>

            <p class="placeholder-text">ETBD has taught me a variety of skills. For starters, I'm experienced in graphic design using a variety of tools such as Adobe Illustrator and Canva. With this experience, I've developed logos, illustrations, and icons. I've also learned some analytical skills such as the core terms of marketing and data (4P’s of marketing, Data cube dimensions, user funnel), analytical measurements (4 major scales (NOIR), statistical significance, Net promoter score), and Digital marketing (Open rate, Cost per Order, Cost per Click, etc). I've also been learning technical subjects such as IT (The ethics behind it and MobaXTerm) and Python programming (Syntax, creating/manipulating files, basic programs). While most of my interests stem from technology and science, I am open to learning other potential skills to enhance my career.
