When I first saw this uniform in the game, I became drawn to the original design. Mainly, the glowing stripes on the sleeves which I thought were an original touch. I began with sketches of how I could potentially make this outfit. I wanted to use an existing jacket and add on features such as the lights on the sleeves and cosmetic details. I bought a cheap, nylon jacket and removed the vinyl logo to make it appear generic. I then attempted to install the electroluminescent wire (Or EL wire as it's better known) on the sleeves. I also wanted to wear it back and forth to add thickness to the lights. I attempted to attach it with transparent thread directly onto the jacket. It always looked messy after many attempts. I had to figure out another way to attach the ELwire to the sleeves. A solution came to me one night and it was to make a bracket to thread the wire through and sew the bracket directly to the jacket. These brackets would have 5 holes to thread the EL wire through and mounting points for the tread. I designed these brackets in CAD software and printed them on mass using my 3D printer. After I had them printed, I threaded the EL wire and attached them to the sleeves. I then added embroidered patches to the collar to make it look futuristic. I then attached shoulder pads with velcro and added a 14” vinyl design to put on the back of the jacket. Once those features were added, I moved on to the pants. I bought some cheap black jeans and applied purple strips of vinyl to the ankles to match the color pallet of the jacket. To further make the pants match with the jacket, I added a large “MaxTac” logo down the side. While I wanted to add more features to the jacket and pants such as MOLLE webbing like you see on military gear, to protective knee/elbow pads to make it look more tactical, I ran out of time due to an upcoming event. I've learned some new lessons during this project.">

It was for a media archaeology class run by Dr Anna Weisling. My project used an ARHT Hologram to display anonymous messages on ghosting using P5.js animation. Over the course of a few months, I've been passively collecting anonymous responses to a single prompt, “What would you say to a person that ghosted you?”. I advertised this collection by making small QR code notes with a ghost on it saying “Got Ghosted”I presented these quotes in an animated phone mimicking a group chat. I had rock music playing in the background in order to send a message of being rebellious against this emerging social norm. These responses ranged from rage to forgiving. 
            
            I would also like to note that I consider this project to be my Magnum Opus. The greatest thing I've ever made as of now for its style, commentary on a real world issue, personal collection of data, and that I had the opportunity to present it.">

The databanks in cyberpunk are a means to transport large amounts of data to be used on site. I wanted to make something similar with current technology. What the device would do is display txt files pulled from an SD card.. The SD card would contain multiple files of digitised information that I have personally acquired. The plan was to use an Arduino microcontroller to run the machine. The design required a display that wasn't an LCD screen and an SD card reader. The Databank would also have a navigation feature by having buttons control the filepath. Once I have figured out all the electronics, I'll 3D print a custom case to house it. While this project is still in development, I look forward to the final result and reflecting on the challenges that lead me there.

I've always wanted a custom jacket tailored to my design. I shopped for patches online only to find none that appealed to me. I then designed a variety of patches using my graphic design skills and embroidered them onto pieces of fabric. I cut out the designs and I sewed them into the jacket. Some of the patches have meaning while others are some of my favorite things. The patch with the most meaning is the neon human heart. It's meant to represent the passion and learning curve I put in my projects. The patch on my collar is meant to be a serial number emulating the Cyberpunk genre and how there are identifying features on almost everything. It also emulates the Cyberpunk genre in how stylized it is with imagery and colors.">

            <article id="project5-box" class="content-box project-card" data-title="Glowing collar" data-detail="This is a glowing collar I've built for my custom jacket. This design is also inspired by the cyberpunk genre, most notably Cyberpunk 2077 by CD Projekt Red. This was the first wearable technology project I've done so this presented many challenges. For starters, I wanted to have the collar detach from the jacket so I can clean it in the wash. I then needed to come up with an original design for the collar itself to house the electronics. Finally, I had to find a light source that would look visually appealing. I identified my light source by using electroluminescent tape. It simplified the project by not having to worry about adjusting the brightness of LEDs and figuring out how to diffuse the light. This project went through a number of redesigns such as having a more ergonomically friendly design by having a more round curvature. This new design also made the collar look more visually appealing with the jacket by looking more narrow. This project taught me how to learn from design flaws and product design. In the future, I hope to design a Mark 2 model where the battery pack is integrated into the collar itself and not running down my jacket.">
